# Gender-to-Pronoun Mapping Skill (Hebrew → English)

## Core Concept

Hebrew shows gender in verb forms and adjectives.
English shows gender in pronouns.

These must be properly mapped.

```
Hebrew feminine verb: קראה (she-read-feminine)
English pronoun: "She"

Hebrew masculine verb: קרא (he-read-masculine)
English pronoun: "He"
```

## Hebrew Gender Markers

### In Verbs (Past Tense)

| Form | Gender | English | Example |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| קראתי | 1st person | I | I read |
| קראת | 2nd masculine | You (m) | You read |
| קראת | 2nd feminine | You (f) | You read |
| קרא | 3rd masculine | He | He read |
| קראה | 3rd feminine | She | She read |
| קראנו | 1st plural | We | We read |
| קראתם | 2nd plural (m) | You (pl) | You (all) read |
| קראתן | 2nd plural (f) | You (all-f) | You (all) read |
| קראו | 3rd plural | They | They read |

### In Adjectives

| Ending | Gender | English Context |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| -ה (or -ית) | Feminine | "She is..." |
| (no special ending) | Masculine | "He is..." |
| -ים | Plural masculine | "They (m) are..." |
| -ות | Plural feminine | "They (f) are..." |

## Application

### Example 1: Past Tense Verb Form

```
Hebrew: "קראה את הספר"
Breaking: קראה = read-FEMININE
Meaning: Subject must be feminine = "she"
English: "She read the book"
```

### Example 2: Adjective Form

```
Hebrew: "היא טובה"
Breaking: טובה = good-FEMININE (ends in -ה)
Meaning: Describes feminine subject
English: "She is good"
```

### Example 3: Present Tense

```
Hebrew: "הוא קורא"
Breaking: קורא = reading-MASCULINE (no special ending)
English: "He is reading"
```

## Subject Identification from Verb Form

When you see a Hebrew verb form:

1. **Extract the gender marker** from the verb ending
2. **Determine subject gender** from the verb form
3. **Use appropriate English pronoun** that matches gender

```
Hebrew verb: רואה (seeing-feminine)
↓
Gender marker: -ה ending = feminine
↓
Subject must be: feminine = "she"
↓
English: "She sees..."
```

## Common Verb Form Patterns

### Feminine Subject Markers

| Tense | Feminine Marker | Example | English |
|-------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| Past | -ה | קראה | She read |
| Present | ה- prefix | היא קוראה | She reads |
| Future | ת- prefix | תקרא | She will read |

### Masculine Subject Markers

| Tense | Masculine Marker | Example | English |
|-------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| Past | (no marker) | קרא | He read |
| Present | (no marker) | הוא קורא | He reads |
| Future | י- prefix | יקרא | He will read |

## Plural Forms

```
Hebrew: קראו (they read - masculine/mixed plural)
Hebrew: קראו (they read - could also be feminine plural)
English: "They read"
(In English, "they" works for all plural)
```

## Adjective Gender Agreement

When translating adjectives, the gender should match the subject:

```
Hebrew: "היא טובה"
Breaking: היא = she, טובה = good-feminine
Agreement: feminine subject + feminine adjective ✓
English: "She is good"

Hebrew: "הוא טוב"
Breaking: הוא = he, טוב = good-masculine
Agreement: masculine subject + masculine adjective ✓
English: "He is good"
```

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Find the Verb/Adjective

```
Hebrew: "הילד הטוב קרא"
Components:
- Verb: קרא (read) - masculine
- Adjective: טוב (good) - masculine
```

### Step 2: Identify Gender Markers

```
קרא → masculine ending (no special marker)
טוב → masculine ending (no ה or ית)
```

### Step 3: Determine English Pronoun

```
Gender markers = masculine
↓
English pronoun = "he" or "boy"
```

### Step 4: Construct English

```
"The good boy read..."
or
"He read..."
```

## Quality Checklist

✓ Identified all gender-marked words (verbs, adjectives)
✓ Extracted gender markers correctly
✓ Matched English pronoun to Hebrew gender
✓ Adjectives match subject gender
✓ Verbs conjugated correctly for English
✓ Pronoun matches throughout sentence
✓ No gender mismatches in final English

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Ignoring Gender Marker

❌ "Hebrew קראה" → "He read" (ignoring feminine -ה)
✓ "Hebrew קראה" → "She read"

### Error 2: Inconsistent Pronoun

❌ "She read the book and he understood" (one subject, two pronouns)
✓ "She read the book and understood it"

### Error 3: Adjective-Subject Mismatch

❌ "The good-feminine boy-masculine"
✓ "The good boy" (both masculine)

### Error 4: Wrong Gender from Context

✓ Trust the Hebrew grammar, not context
```
Hebrew: הילד אומר (boy speaking - masculine verb form)
English: "The boy says..." (matches masculine)
```

**Always let Hebrew gender markers determine English pronouns and adjectives.**
